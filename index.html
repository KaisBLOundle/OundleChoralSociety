        <p class="big">We are a mixed voice choir who have been in existence for over 100 years. We draw our membership from a fairly wide rural area and currently have <br> approximately seventy voices who meet for rehearsals <strong>every monday during term time</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p class="big"> Although we are an independent choral society, we have close links with Oundle School with whom we often perform and who regularly support our concerts. <br> <strong>Our rehearsals are held in Laxton Junior School Hall, East Road, Oundle, PE8 4BX, from 7.30pm until 9.30pm.</strong></p>
        <br>
        <p class="big"> There is no requirement to audition and all singers are made welcome no matter what skill level you have. We are grateful to Oundle Town Council for their continuing financial support but, much like most societies, we are a registered charity and are obliged to charge a subscription fee. However, don’t let that stop you from coming along to see if you like us!</p>

His four Masters’ Degrees and Associateship to the Royal College of Organists are indicative of his diverse interests across the music world that have encompassed composition, conducting, performing and music education.</p>

            <p class="big">Composing hi-lights include two Oscar nominations in Hollywood’s Short Film category; being an in-house composer for a publisher whilst still at school; three operas, one opening a Deutsche Oper am Rhein, Dusseldorf season. He has written diverse works ranging from song cycles to orchestral works, sound designs to choral and dance works for leading artists and ensembles in most of the London major concert venues.</p>
            
            <p class="big">As a conductor, Quentin has considerable experience in bringing the best out of semi-professional and amateur outfits, be they massed choruses, community choirs, orchestras or school ensembles. He has formed and run many a festival such as the Guildhall School’s Festival of Contemporary Music, and the St John’s Hyde Park Festival. He is presently a trustee of Creative Oundle.</p>
            
            <p class="big">As an educationalist, Quentin has been Director of Music at Oundle since 2013. He was for eight years Director of Music at Haileybury, taking the choir to the finals of the BBC Songs of Praise Choir of the Year in the three times they entered the competition.
